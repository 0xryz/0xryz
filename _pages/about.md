Hey, I'm 0xryz - a full-time bug bounty hunter and security researcher based in Cairo, Egypt.

I specialize in finding vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs, helping organizations improve their security through responsible disclosure.

Check out my [writeups](/writeups/) for detailed technical breakdowns of vulnerabilities I've discovered, and my [stories](/stories/) for insights into the bug bounty hunting journey.
